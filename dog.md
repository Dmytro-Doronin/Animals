## Description
The dog (Canis familiaris or Canis lupus familiaris) is a domesticated descendant of the gray wolf. Also called the domestic dog, it was selectively 
bred from a population of wolves during the Late Pleistocene 
by hunter-gatherers. The dog was the first species to be 
domesticated by humans, over 14,000 years ago and before 
the development of agriculture. Due to their long 
association with humans, dogs have gained the ability 
to thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be inadequate 
for other canids.
