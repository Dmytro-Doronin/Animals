## Description
A black cat is a domestic cat with black fur. 
While many breeds can have black coats, the 
Bombay is the only breed that is exclusively black. 
Black cats are often associated with superstitions and 
folklore, both positive and negative, across different 
cultures. In some cultures, they are seen as symbols of 
good luck, while in others, they are associated with bad 
luck or even witchcraft.
